## Todo App built with Next.js, Prisma, and SQLite

## Key Technologies:

Next.js: Framework for building server-rendered and statically generated React apps.
Prisma: ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) that simplifies database interactions in Node.js and TypeScript.
SQLite: File-based relational database for efficient storage.

## Key Features:

1. Todo Management: Users can create, view, edit, mark as completed, and delete tasks.
2. User-Friendly UI: Provides a clear and intuitive interface for managing tasks.
3. Data Persistence: Tasks are persistently stored in the SQLite database.
4. TypeScript Support: Prisma and Next.js offer excellent TypeScript integration for type safety and maintainability.

## Architecture:

1. Prisma Schema: Defines the database structure using a declarative syntax, making migrations and updates easier.
2. Next.js API Routes: Handle CRUD operations on tasks using Prisma Client, ensuring type-safe database interactions.
   
## Benefits:

1. Simplified Database Handling: Prisma streamlines database interactions and reduces boilerplate code.
2. Type Safety: TypeScript ensures type consistency throughout the app, reducing errors and improving readability.
3. Fast Development: Next.js's features and Prisma's ease of use accelerate development.
4. Good Performance: SQLite's efficiency and Next.js's optimization techniques contribute to fast app performance.
5. No External Database Setup: SQLite's file-based nature eliminates the need for external database setup.




This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
